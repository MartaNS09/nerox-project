        <p className="services-text mb-10">
          SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a technology for promoting a website in search results in order to get traffic. The work is based on the knowledge of algorithms for ranking resources in the search results and improving the criteria of the site in order to bring it to the top of the search results for the required key phrases.
        </p>
        <p className="services-text mb-10">
          As a result of high-quality SEO, the site rises in the search engine results, which means that the link to the promoted page receives traffic from visitors, which will be the greater, the higher the position of such a link.
        </p>
        <p className="services-text mb-10">
          The principle of operation looks very simple: the user enters a query of interest to him, and the search engine builds a list of links to resources in a certain order. After that, the potential client gets acquainted with a brief description of the resource and goes to it if it interests him. The higher in the results such a link is, the more likely the transition is, since the user usually does not go beyond the first page of the issue.
        </p>
        <p className="services-text mb-40">
          The principle of constructing search results on demand uses a complex sorting formula that takes into account dozens of parameters. At the same time, the exact algorithm for such a ranking is not disclosed by the owners of search engines, who voice only the general principles of building a high-quality and useful resource for people, helping to climb to the top. In practice, without the use of SEO promotion technologies, it is almost impossible to bring a site to the first page of search results in highly competitive commercial topics, even if its content and technical implementation are perfect.
